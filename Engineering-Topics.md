Solving Problems

Take what ever the problem is in steps, like this:
1. Read the problem completely twice.
    - This is important to completely understand the problem
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - Nothing can be automated that can't be done manually
1. Optimize the manual steps.
    - Easier to optimize a plan already laid out than to create an optimized one
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - Get the structure of the code out, don't worry about syntax too much, just the plan
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    - Just convert previous step to code, if it is difficult probably didn't break down the problem enough
1. Optimize the real code.
    - Just try to simplify, reduce line count, make better

Act like you make $1000/hr

This one seems to apply to me quite a bit. 
I don't really value my time that much and end up spending lots of time wasted on either TV or video games or other stuff. But at other times I want to be super productive and end up not taking enough breaks and not wanting to be productive any more. I appreciate the part about saying no to some things, and using the time for things you prioritize more instead.

How to think like a programmer

Progamming is essentially a more efficient way for problem solving.
The main steps in problem solving:
1. Understand
    - Make sure you can explain it in simple terms
1. Plan
    - Write out the steps
1. Divide
    - Break the problem into sub-problems, then connect them together
1. Stuck?
    - Do these three things:
    1. Debug
    1. Reassess
    1. Research
And make sure to keep on practicing

5 Whys and 5 Hows

When to use:
- 5 Whys
    - Delve into root causes. Brainstorming and cause and effect diagrams
- 5 Hows
    - Brainstorming, solution-focused cause and effect diagrams

How to use:
1. Draw a box at the top of a piece of flip chart paper and clearly write down the problem or solution to be explored.
1. Below the statement box draw five lines in descending order.
1. Ask "why" or "how" five times and write the answers on the lines drawn from number one to five.
1. It may take less or more than five times to reach the root cause or solution.
