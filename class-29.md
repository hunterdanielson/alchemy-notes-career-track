## MVC 

### What is it

Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.This kind of pattern is used for designing the layout of the page.

### MVC Architechture

- View
    - Presentational Components
    - Container Components
    - Application Services
    - Store
    - Domain
    - Domain Services
- Application Services
- Store
- Domain

The guiding light of Model View Controller (MVC) is separating presentation from domain. Why is that important to do? Our application’s “domain” is where we model our perception of the problem and its solution. By making this code separate—without reference to any UI—it could be modeled more correctly, tested more deeply, and presented more numerously.
