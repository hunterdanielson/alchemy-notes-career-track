Objects

Initializing with shortcuts seems like it could save time as well as simplify things later on.
Object literals can be computed values or assigned functions.

Classes

Classes and inheritence seem cool, I still don't totally understand what the constructor does, and I've seen super in there somewhere. But it will make more sense eventually.
Static vs dynamic methods are a bit confusing, but seem helpful.
Extending seems to make sense, it just makes a sub-class of another kind of thing.

Destructuring

Seems like it can save a bunch of time with variable declarations. It makes the code shorter and cleaner, and can be easier to read as well.

Rest

Makes one able to represent an indefinite amount of variables or arguements. Is prefixed with '...' before the last parameter.

Spread

Spread allows one to make an iterable array, string or other expression to be expanded in places such as function calls. It seems like it could save a lot of time later down the road when inputing tons of things into a function.


Function Defaults

Allows a default value to be in place for a parameter if no value is passed in.

More Practice

I went through some of these practice exercises, and will continue to go through and practice more of these.
